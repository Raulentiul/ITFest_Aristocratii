## Description
Python app that simulates the flow of emergency vehicles (fire trucks, police cars and ambulances) from the nearest station to random positioned points on a map using the GUI library Kivy. The repository from which it is forked contains much more: an arduino script that was connected to the software and could visually represent how traffic lights in intersections changed red for all lanes except the one that the emergency vehicle was coming from (we made a lego set-up of an intersection with leds for traffic lights).

There is a video of how the application looks like: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tqkKBhg848rfxPNViJ4RZTfAaStd_8vg/view?usp=drive_link

There is also an admin role that helps modify the traffic lights that are stored as a json file.
